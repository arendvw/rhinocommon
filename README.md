Get Involved (contributing)
---------------------------
There are many ways to contribute to this project:

* Report bugs/wishes to the issue list at https://github.com/mcneel/rhinocommon/issues
* Directly edit the source code using git. If you need help with this, please let us know.

Compiling the Source
--------------------
You are going to need:

* The latest Rhino5 (http://www.rhino3d.com/nr.htm)
* Visual C# 2010

Steps:

* Get the source code by downloading everything as a zip or using git

I'm going to need to come up with better instructions on compiling and using the dll, but in a nutshell you should be able to debug into the RhinoCommon source code by:

* rename the shipping RhinoCommon.dll to something like RhinoCommon.dll.original
* place the RhinoCommon.dll and pdb that gets compiled by this project in the Rhino5 system directory

Installation / Configuration
----------------------------
RhinoCommon is written to work under different "modes".
- Assembly running in Rhino: Rhino 5 (and Grasshopper in Rhino 4) ship a precompiled version of RhinoCommon that contains full access to the Rhino SDK. This means highre level functionality of things like intersections or working with the RhinoDoc are supported
- Stand alone assembly accessing OpenNURBS: A special build flavor of RhinoCommon is supported that let's you build RhinoCommon as a .NET layer on top of the C++ OpenNURBS toolkit (www.opennurbs.org)
